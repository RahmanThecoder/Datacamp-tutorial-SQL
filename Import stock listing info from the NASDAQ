...question....
In this video, you learned how to use the pd.read_csv() function to import data from a csv file containing companies
listed on the AmEx Stock Exchange into a pandas DataFrame. You can apply this same knowledge to 
import listing information in csv files from other stock exchanges.
The next step is to ensure that the contents of the DataFrame accurately reflect the meaning of
your data. Two essential methods to understand your data are .head(), which displays the first five rows
of your data by default, and .info(), which summarizes elements of a DataFrame such as content, data types, and missing values.
In this exercise, you will read the file nasdaq-listings.csv with data on companies listed on the NASDAQ 
and then diagnose issues with the imported data. You will fix these issues in the next exercise.
